	STATE ARRAY

The state array contains the current state of the rocket at any given time. Contains the following values:

	> Absolute velocity of the rocket with respect to ground
	> Flight path angle, angle between the velocity vector
          of the rocket and the local horizon, in radians
	> Horizontal distance between the rocket and the
    	  launch site, in meters
	> Altitude of the rocket above SL, in meters
 	> Total mass of the rocket, in kg


	PARAMETER STRUCTURE

The parameter structure is subdivided in three substructures: Constant, Rocket and Control. Each of these can be accessed using the dot character(.), as follows: Parameter.Constant, Parameter.Rocket and Parameter.Control

Inside Constant, variables realted to constant values required in the computations are located, such as the gravity acceleration at sea level (earthSLGravity) or the Earth radius (earthRadius).

In Rocket, the intial mass and the number of stages are present, as well as an array of structures, Stage(i), where i is the number of the stage. Each stage contains inital mass, maximum thrust (in N), specific impulse (in s), payload and structural ratios, cross section and coefficient of drag. To access, for example, the maximum specific impulse of the third stage, the name of the variable would be "Parameter.Rocket.Stage(3).Isp". The Rocket substructure is generated by LaunchTrajectory/Functions/extract_rocket_data.m from a file.

In Control, variables related to the inputs given to the rocket are located. Still work in progress (more than the other parts)
