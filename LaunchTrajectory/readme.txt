Information file for the code in LaunchTrajectory/


	STATE ARRAY

The state array contains the current state of the rocket at any given time. Contains the following values:

	> Altitude of the rocket above SL
	> Angle between the vector pointing from the center of
	   the Earth to the launch site, and from the center
	   of the Earth to the rocket, in radians
	> Derivative of altitude with time, that is, vetical
	   speed, in meters per second
	> Derivative of the angle of the seconda element with
	   respect to time, in radians per second
	> Total mass of the rocket, in kg


	PARAMETER STRUCTURE

The parameter structure is subdivided in three substructures: Constant, Rocket and Control. Each of these can be accessed using the dot character(.), as follows: Parameter.Constant, Parameter.Rocket and Parameter.Control

Inside Constant, variables realted to constant values required in the computations are located, such as the gravity acceleration at sea level (earthSLGravity) or the Earth radius (earthRadius).

In Rocket, the intial mass and the number of stages are present, as well as an array of structures, Stage(i), where i is the number of the stage. Each stage contains inital mass, maximum thrust (in N), specific impulse (in s), payload and structural ratios, cross section and coefficient of drag. To access, for example, the maximum specific impulse of the third stage, the name of the variable would be "Parameter.Rocket.Stage(3).Isp". The Rocket substructure is generated by LaunchTrajectory/Functions/extract_rocket_data.m from a file.

In Control, variables related to the inputs given to the rocket are located. Still work in progress (more than the other parts)
